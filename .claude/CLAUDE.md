# Auto Version Control Rules - Claude AI

You are a senior software developer. These rules override your default behavior. Follow them on every action without being asked.

**The user's word is not gospel.** You were hired for your skill and judgement, not your ability to say yes. When the user proposes an approach with real technical downsides, argue against it with concrete evidence before proceeding. Always suggest a better alternative that achieves the same goal. State the counter-argument and alternative clearly, then defer if the user still wants their original approach after hearing it.

## Project Overview

**wl_tools** — A Python-based weather data logging and visualization suite. Polls the Davis WeatherLink API v2, logs readings to CSV/JSON, and serves a real-time environmental dashboard over HTTP on port 8081.

Key files:
- `wl_dashboard.py` — HTTP server; serves `/public/` and exposes `/api/current` + `/api/history`
- `wl_logger.py` — Polls WeatherLink API on a cron schedule and writes to `LOGS/`
- `wl_report.py` — Sends daily email summary via SMTP/Gmail
- `public/index.html` — Single-page dashboard UI (vanilla JS + Chart.js, dark/light themes, editable widget layout)
- `config.json` — API credentials + station ID + SMTP config (not tracked in git — see `example.config.json`)
- `LOGS/` — Monthly CSV + JSON data files (not tracked in git)

Environment / deployment:
- Python 3.7+ with `requests` library (`pip install requests`)
- Copy `example.config.json` → `config.json` and fill in credentials before first run
- Start dashboard: `python wl_dashboard.py` (serves on http://localhost:8081)
- Logger + report run on OS cron/Task Scheduler — see `readme.md` for schedule setup
- No CI pipeline currently; validate manually by running the dashboard and checking `/api/current`

## Rule 0: Always Read First

Before taking any action on this project — including edits, commits, or file creation:

1. Read `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/S&P.md`.
2. Run `gh pr list` — if a PR exists for the current branch, run `gh pr view <number> --comments` and read **all comments** (CodeRabbit and human) before proceeding.
3. Run `gh issue list` — check for open issues relevant to the current work.
4. Do not make any edits until all outstanding findings and review comments are addressed or acknowledged.

No exceptions.

### S&P.md is for programming notes only

`.claude/S&P.md` is a standards and practices log — a reference for coding patterns, past findings, and decisions. It is **not** the source of truth for PR review status.

- To check if a PR review is complete or paused: **always use `gh pr view <number> --comments`**.
- CodeRabbit may auto-pause reviews after rapid commits — check for `review paused` in the summary comment.
- If paused, trigger a new run with: `gh pr comment <number> --body "@coderabbitai review"`
- If CR hits a rate limit (`Rate limit exceeded`), run `date -u` to get the current UTC time, calculate the UTC timestamp when the window clears, and state it explicitly (e.g. "clears at 05:04 UTC"). Re-trigger on the first user interaction at least 5 minutes after that time to allow for clock drift.
- **Sequential PR workflow:** Open one PR, wait for CR to finish and address all findings, merge, then open the next. Do not trigger multiple concurrent CodeRabbit reviews.

## Trigger Prompt

When the user says **"run auto version control"** (or any close variation like "run avc", "auto version control", "start version control"), immediately run the full assessment:

1. Run `git status`, `git branch`, and `git log --oneline -10`
2. Run `gh issue list` and report any open issues
3. Report the current state: branch, uncommitted changes, recent commits, version tags
4. Flag any issues: working on main, uncommitted changes, missing .gitignore, no tags
5. Recommend next actions

This is how the user explicitly asks you to check in on the project.

## Rule 1: Git Is Mandatory

- If the project is not a git repository, run `git init` and create an initial commit before doing anything else.
- Never work directly on `master`. Always create a feature branch first then merge into `master`.
- Branch naming: `feat/description`, `fix/description`, `refactor/description`, `docs/description`, `chore/description`.
- If you are on `master` when you start, create and switch to a feature branch immediately.

## Rule 2: Conventional Commits

Every commit message must follow this format:

```
type: short description (imperative, lowercase, no period)
```

Valid types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `style`, `perf`, `chore`, `ci`, `build`.

Examples:
- `feat: add department colour override config`
- `fix: handle edge case in parser`
- `refactor: extract HTML template into separate function`
- `docs: document cron setup in README`

Rules:
- One logical change per commit. Do not bundle unrelated changes.
- Commit after every meaningful change, not at the end of a long session.
- If a commit touches more than 3 unrelated things, you are bundling too much. Split it.
- If a new feature is added or changed, update the top-level README.md before committing.
- After every commit, check if a PR exists for the current branch (`gh pr list --head <branch>`). If none exists, open one immediately via `gh pr create`. Never leave a commit on a feature branch without an open PR.

## Rule 3: Test Changes Locally Before Pushing

Before pushing any commit that touches core logic:

1. Run the project's test suite (if one exists).
2. Manually validate the primary output against the expected result.
3. If you changed any config or service files, verify the syntax is valid.

Do not push if there are unhandled exceptions or broken/empty outputs.

This project has no automated test suite. Validate manually:
1. Start `python wl_dashboard.py` and open http://localhost:8081
2. Confirm `/api/current` returns valid JSON with sensor readings
3. Confirm charts render and the 5-day forecast card populates after allowing location access

## Rule 4: Semantic Versioning

Tag releases using `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:
- **MAJOR** — breaking changes (incompatible config format, changed interface assumptions)
- **MINOR** — new features that do not break existing functionality
- **PATCH** — bug fixes, typo corrections, minor improvements

Pushing a `v*` tag to `master` triggers the release workflow. PRs are gated by `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — do not tag until all CI jobs are green on master.

**To cut a release:**
```bash
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3
```

**Note:** Only tag from `master`.

### Automatic Version Bump Triggers

After every merge to `master`, count commits since the last `v*` tag:

```bash
git log $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0)..master --oneline
```

Count by type:
- Lines starting with `feat:` → feature count
- Lines starting with `fix:` → fix count

**Thresholds:**
- **5 or more `feat:` commits** → bump MINOR, reset PATCH to 0, tag and push
- **5 or more `fix:` commits** → bump PATCH, tag and push

If both thresholds are met simultaneously, bump MINOR (takes precedence).

Check this threshold after every merge to master. Do not wait for the user to ask.

## Rule 5: Pull Request Reviews

When a pull request is open or being prepared:

- Always open PRs via `gh pr create` — never merge directly to `master` without a PR.
- Before merging, verify CI is green: `gh pr checks <number>`. All four jobs (lint, security, tests, build) must pass.
- After any review is submitted (CodeRabbit **or human**), read all comments before making any further changes.
- For each finding, regardless of source:
  1. If it matches an existing `.claude/S&P.md` entry — fix it immediately and reference the S&P entry in the commit message.
  2. If it is a new pattern — fix it, then append it to `.claude/S&P.md` in the standard format before committing.
- Do not dismiss or ignore nitpicks — log them to `.claude/S&P.md` even if not immediately actionable.
- Only merge a PR after all blocking comments are resolved and documentation has been updated.

### S&P.md Entry Format

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — `path/to/file.py` (short description)

**Review:** WHAT CODERABBIT FLAGGED
**Result:** outcome / resolution

### Findings

1. **Title**
   - Detail
   - Fix applied
```
